Description: Provides functions that allow to compute posterior distributions of 
  Bayesian logistic regression models (BLRMs) for monotherapy and combination 
  therapy dose-finding trials and summarizing them via dosing 
  intervals. Data scenarios can be evaluated and trial simulations can be 
  conducted for multiple variants of the BLRM. Most importantly, functions are 
  provided to aid BLRM-based dose finding for monotherapy (Neuenschwander et al. 
  (2008) <doi:10.1002/sim.3230>) and combination therapy trials (Neuenschwander 
  et al. (2014) <doi:10.1201/b17965>). Further, functions to evaluate a joint 
  BLRM for monotherapy and combination therapy (Neuenschwander et al. (2016) 
  <doi:10.1080/19466315.2016.1174149>), and BLRMs with additional binary 
  covariate are included in the package. All Bayesian models are evaluated using
  the 'Stan' modeling language via the package 'rstan', refer to Stan 
  Development Team (2020) <https://mc-stan.org>.
