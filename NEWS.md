# decider 0.0.0.9011

* This is the first version of the `decider` package on github. 

* Functions for scenario evaluation and simulation of a hierarchical/joint
BLRM for two-drug combination therapy are provided, allowing in particular
for trial designs consisting of concurrent monotherapy and combination
therapy escalation, including potentially data from historical trials.

* The main functions are: [`scenario_jointBLRM()`]((../reference/scenario_jointBLRM.html)) 
and [`sim_jointBLRM`]((../reference/sim_jointBLRM.html)). Both functions have 
a second version that additionally allows to the use of a binary covariate.
