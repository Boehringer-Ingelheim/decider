# decider R package
This package was created to allow the use of Bayesian logistic regression models 
(BLRMs) for decision making in oncology dose escalation trials with multiple 
arms. It focuses on the use of the meta-analytic ("joint") BLRM for mono- and
combination therapy, which uses a hierarchical prior structure. The package
comes with various functions allowing to evaluate the BLRM and a chosen prior
using simulations or hypothetical data scenarios. Additionally, it provides
the necessary tools for the actual data analysis and visualization of
model results in practice.
