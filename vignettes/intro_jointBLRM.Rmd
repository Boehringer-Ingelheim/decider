This vignette illustrates the usage of the `decider` package for setting up and evaluating
prior distributions for joint Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM)-based dose-finding trials with one or more monotherapy
and/or two-compund combination therapy trials that may run sequentially or in parallel. It will
be assumed that the reader is familiar with the general process of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)-based
dose-finding trials with the aim of determining a maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and with
the BLRM and its meta-analytic extensions (here referred to as joint BLRM) for DLT-based dose finding.
For an introduction to these topics, refer to [@neuenschwander08], [@neuenschwander14], [@neuenschwander16].
While this terminology and the applied methods mainly originated in the context
of oncology dose finding, the methods contained in this vignette can also be
applied to other therapeutic areas. Note that different therapeutic areas
may be using a slightly different notions instead of e.g. DLT and MTD.

Note further that the term "trial" may also refer to a trial arm (e.g. monotherapy
and combination therapy), and that the model will not differentiate between these notions.
Moreover, the term "study" will refer to the complete conduct of all jointly modeled
trials. That is, simulating e.g. 10 studies means that all involved trials are simulated in
the specified order and under the remaining specified assumptions for in total
10 times.

## Overview of the main tools
The package ships with two main functions, which are called `scenario_jointBLRM`
and `sim_jointBLRM`. The former is essentially a high-level wrapper for fitting
a joint BLRM to a concrete data scenario, while the latter allows to simulate
the course of a number of dose-finding trials under the assumption of a specific
dose-toxicity scenario, i.e. a specification of the DLT rates of the involved dose
levels.

### `scenario_jointBLRM`
The function `scenario_jointBLRM` is essentially a wrapper for a Stan model of
the joint BLRM, which is internally used to sample from the posterior distribution
given a set of input data using the so-called No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) algorithm.
For details on the technicalities behind Stan, a good starting place is Stan's
[homepage](https://mc-stan.org).

However, besides fitting the model, the function will also perform a number of
further evaluations based on the posterior. Most importantly, the posterior
distribution of the DLT rates (referred to as posterior toxicities
in the following) for a given set of dose levels is
determined based on the fitted model. In actual dose-finding trials these
distributions will form the basis of the recommended dose level for the next cohort.

The output of `scenario_jointBLRM` consist of a summary of these posterior
toxicities, as well as an evaluation of them in terms of an specific escalation rule.
Here, the term escalation rule refers to a method that derives a dosing recommendation
based on the fitted BLRM. Currently, the `decider` package supports the popular escalation
with overdose control (EWOC)-based escalation rules [@babb98], as well as loss-based
escalation rules, which are however not considered in this vignette.
Note that EWOC-based escalation is the default setting of all functions, so that without further
specifications, the functions will assume that EWOC is applied. Essentially, EWOC computes
the probability that the DLT rate of a dose lies above a prespecified target dosing interval
(often from 16\% to 33\% DLT rate), and demands that this probability does not exceed
a certain boundary, typically 0.25 (the default). Both the interval and the boundary
can be adapted by the user. For EWOC-based escalation, the summary that `scenario_jointBLRM`
creates will contain the resulting posterior interval probabilities of underdosing, target dosing,
and overdosing, as well as summary statistics of the posterior of the DLT rates of
a given set of doses of interest (which are usually the set of possible dose levels in the trial).

Additionally, plots of the posterior interval probabilities can be created,
which visualize the EWOC principle and the set of doses that
is allowed by EWOC based on the given data.

The main uses of `scenario_jointBLRM` are the evaluation of actual and hypothetical
data scenarios and the determination of the resulting posterior. Actual data
scenarios refer here to data that was observed during a trial, while hypothetical
data scenarios are a way of evaluating the on-trial behavior of the BLRM with some
escalation rule in a concrete setting. These are particularly important at the
planning stage of dose-finding trials, as they allow to monitor the performance
of the model in scenarios that are assumed to potentially occur during the trial. Based
on these evaluations, the prior distribution of the BLRM can be adapted to obtain
appropriate escalation behavior.

For evaluating a prior specification at the planning stage of a trial, one will typically
need to consider a whole set of different scenarios that test the model and its recommendation
in a broad spectrum of possible situations. Specifically for this setting, the additional
function `scenario_list_jointBLRM()` is provided, which allows to evaluate a list of
arbitrarily many scenarios via `scenario_jointBLRM()` in parallel.

### `sim_jointBLRM`
When a prior with appropriate on-trial behavior is established, one may want to conduct
more thorough evaluation of the performance of the resulting model. A widely-accepted
way of achieving this are trial simulations. For this, one assumes concrete "true" DLT
rates for the dose levels available in a trial (referred to as dose-toxicity scenario)
and repeatedly simulates the number of DLTs that are observed in cohorts of patients.
Based on this data, the BLRM is fitted and the escalation rule is applied to determine
the dose level for the next cohort, or, potentially, if the trial needs to be stopped early
(this can e.g. happen when the lowest available dose does not satisfy the EWOC criterion).
This process is repeated until a prespecified condition for the declaration of the
MTD is reached, or until the trial is stopped without declaring an MTD (either due to
stopping early or due to reaching the maximum number of patients that can be enrolled).

Such trial simulation can then be used to determine the operating characteristics of the trial
design in specific dose-toxicity scenarios. That is, one simulates a number of trials, e.g. 1000,
and determines the ratio of MTDs declared at specific dose levels (e.g., MTDs at target doses),
as well as further quantities like the average number of patients treated with a specific dose
or the average number of DLTs that occurred during the trial.

This process is then repeated for a number of different scenarios, containing e.g.
low-toxicity scenarios (all doses have DLT rate below the targeted interval), moderate scenarios
(DLT rates range from underdoses over target doses to overdoses), highly toxic scenarios,
and further extreme cases, like e.g. one trial being considerably more toxic than another one.

The function `sim_jointBLRM()` is designed to perform these simulations in a convenient manner and
generate output tables that summarize the operating characteristics of a specified trial design
in concrete dose-toxicity scenarios. It provides the option two simulate up to six trials
running in parallel (which can be activated independently of each other),
namely two monotherapy trials for each involved compound, and two
combination therapy trias which are all included in a joint meta-analytic BLRM which is specified
according to [@neuenschwander14], [@neuenschwander16].

The priors used by the model and the order in which cohorts arrive can be freely specified by the user,
as well as many further options, including escalation rules, MTD selection, starting doses, and additional restrictions
on the increment between escalations. Furthermore, the function allows to include data
from arbitrarily many historical trials (not actively simulated) for the involved compounds.

## Setting up and evaluating priors using `scenario_jointBLRM`
Assume in the following that we are interested in setting up an oncology dose-finding
study that includes two different trials, referred to as Arm A and Arm B in the following.
Suppose that Arm A investigates on some treatment, say compound 1, in a first-in-human
monotherapy setting, while Arm B shall consider combination therapy with compound 1 and
some combination partner, say compound 2. We assume that previous dose-finding trials
for compound 2 were already conducted, so that DLT data is available for monotherapy
with compound 2 from earlier clinical investigations.

Assume further that Arm A and Arm B shall run partially in parallel, or, more precisely,
that Arm B will be initiated before Arm A has concluded (before the trial declared an MTD), provided
that the involved doses of compound 1 were already tested in monotherapy.
To allow exchange of information across Arms A and B, and further the inclusion of
the historical data for compound 2, we will model both trials and the historical
trials in a joint BLRM. The following sections provide an overview how the
function `scenario_jointBLRM` can be set up for this situation, and how it is used
to specify and evaluate an appropriate prior distribution and conduct analyses to
determine the next dose level during the trial.

Before you continue, do not forget to load the `decider` package.

```r
library(decider)
```

### Basic specifications of `scenario_jointBLRM`
As a first step, we will determine the necessary fixed input data, consisting of
a set of available dose levels for Arms A ad B, the set of historical data,
and reference dose levels for both compounds.

First, assume that from an historical monotherapy trial for compound 2, the clinical
data given below is available. Dose levels of the same compound are assumed to be
stated in some fixed unit of measurement, e.g. mg or mg/kg, which is not explicitly
denoted for simplicity.

Dose  | #Patients | #DLT
------|-----------|------
2     | 3         |0
4     | 3         |0
8     | 3         |0
12    | 9         |1
16    | 12        |2

It is further assumed that all of these observations originate from a single
historical trial, although this could easily be extended to multiple historical
trials (described below).

The given data now needs to be written in the format that `scenario_jointBLRM`
accepts, which is a named list containing the entries `dose1`, `dose2`, `n.pat`,
`n.dlt`, and `trial`. For the data given above, use

```r
historical.data = list(
  dose1 = c( 0,    0,    0,    0,    0),
  dose2 = c( 2,    4,    8,    12,   16),
  n.pat = c( 3,    3,    3,    9,    12),
  n.dlt = c( 0,    0,    0,    1,    2),
  trial = c("H1", "H1", "H1", "H1", "H1")
)
```
Here, each column in the structure given above translates to the data observed
at one dose level during a specific historical trial. Note that the dose levels
of compound 2 are given in the entry `dose2`, while the entry of `dose1` is `0`
to indicate that the cohorts received monotherapy with compound 2.

In the example here, only the data from one historical trial is included. For this,
the same entry of `historical.data$trial` is given for each historical cohort,
which tells the function that all of these cohorts belong to the same trial.
The entry `"H1"` is an arbitrarily chosen trial name for the historical trial,
note that one could also use a specific number or some other string as trial name.
When data for multiple historical trials in given, multiple trial names need to
be used to indicate this.

As a next step, we need to specify reference dose levels and the set of available
dose levels for the trial. Although the set of investigational dose levels can be flexible
in practice (i.e., does not need full specification at the planning stage), for prior
evaluations, a hypothetical set of doses that are planned to be used in the
trial need to be specified to allow evaluating the hypothetical on-trial behavior
of the model.

We will in the following assume that the planned monotherapy doses for compound 1
are

```r
d1 = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 2.4, 3.6, 5, 6)
```
where we have again left out the unit of measurement (e.g. g or mg/kg) for simplicity.
Regarding combination therapy, suppose that it is planned to consider all combinations
of the monotherapy doses of compound 1 with the dose levels

```r
d2 = c(8, 12)
```
of compound 2 (given in the same unit of measurement as the doses in the historical data).

The planned monotherapy and combination therapy doses should be given to the function
via the argument `doses.of.interest`, which specifies which dose levels need to be
evaluated. The argument needs to be a matrix with two rows and one column for each
dose level, where monotherapy doses are indicated by placing `0` or `NA` in the entry
of the other compound.

In the setting specified above, this results in

```r
doses.of.interest = rbind( c(d1,                  rep(d1, times=length(d2))),
                           c(rep(0, length(d1)),  rep(d2, each=length(d1))) )

#monotherapy compound 1.
doses.of.interest[, 1:length(d1)]
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9]
#> [1,]  0.1  0.2  0.4  0.8  1.6  2.4  3.6    5    6
#> [2,]  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0    0    0

#combinations of compound 1 with dose 8 of compound 2.
doses.of.interest[, (length(d1)+1):(2*length(d1))]
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9]
#> [1,]  0.1  0.2  0.4  0.8  1.6  2.4  3.6    5    6
#> [2,]  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0    8    8

#combinations of compound 1 with dose 12 of compound 2.
doses.of.interest[, (2*length(d1)+1):(3*length(d1))]
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9]
#> [1,]  0.1  0.2  0.4  0.8  1.6  2.4  3.6    5    6
#> [2,] 12.0 12.0 12.0 12.0 12.0 12.0 12.0   12   12
```

Next, we need to specify the reference doses used by the joint BLRM. We assume that
for compound 1 the dose `6` and for compound 2 the dose `12` was selected for this:

```r
dose.ref1 = 6
dose.ref2 = 12
```

To explicitly tell the function that we are interested in two trials
which consider monotherapy for compound 1, respectively combination therapy, we now
include the following optional arguments:

```r
trials.of.interest = c("A",     "B")
types.of.interest =  c("mono1", "combi")
```

The trial names `"A"` and `"B"` are arbitrary and tell the function that this is
how we will indicate the two trials in the data. The types `"mono1"` and `"combi"`
specify that only the `doses.of.interest` for the corresponding trial type
need to be analyzed for the corresponding trial. That is, trial `"A"` is the
trial of type `"mono1"` and will only consider monotherapy with compound 1,
while `"combi"` indicates that trial `"B"` will only consider combination
therapy doses. There is also the type `"all"` which will cause the function to
analyze all given doses of interest for a trial.

If the trials of interest or their type are not explicitly specified,
the function will use all trial names given in data and historical data
(in our case, including the trial `"H1"` from the historical data), and further
try to infer the type from the given data for this trial. If this is not possible,
(e.g. when no data is given yet), the function will provide posteriors for all
doses of interest for this trial. Therefore, specifying trials of interest and
their types allows to control which output is included in a more precise fashion.

Furthermore, when we do not provide data for trial `"A"` or `"B"` yet (e.g. to obtain
the predictive distribution induced by the data from the other included trials), the function
would not include the posterior of the trial in the output unless its name is specified
explicitly as a trial of interest. For instance, when only the historical data
is given, the function would only estimate the posterior of the historical trials
but not estimate the predictive distribution of a new trial based on the historical data.

At this point, we could in principle already run the function to produce posterior
predictive distributions for the trials `"A"` and `"B"` purely from the historical data of trial `"H1"`
(which is equivalent to a meta-analytic predictive prior, cf. [@neuenschwander16]).
However, we still have not specified a (hyper-)prior distribution for the model,
so that the function would apply the default prior configuration (refer to the documentation
of `scenario_jointBLRM`). While the default prior is weakly informative and was
found to be quite flexible across different situations, it is still recommended
to specify a prior manually to ensure good on-trial behavior of the model
This will be the subject of the next section.

### Specifying a prior for the joint BLRM
Refer to the section Detail in the documentation of `scenario_jointBLRM` for a model
specification of the joint BLRM and explanations what the model does. For the
following, it is only important to know that the prior specifications consist
of two parts, namely, a prior for the hyper-means (argument `prior.mu`) and a prior
for the between-trial heterogeneities (argument `prior.tau`), where the hyper-mean
is the shared mean of the parameters across trials and the between-trial heterogeneity
is the standard deviation across trials. Recall the five
different parameters of the joint BLRM: two parameters for each compound
(more precisely, the intercept $log(\alpha_i)$ and the log-slope $log(\beta_i)$ for
compound $i$), and the interaction parameter, $\eta$. Hence, the prior specification
must specify the distribution of the hypermean and between-trial heterogeneity
for these five parameters.

For this, it is assumed that all hypermeans follow normal distributions with some
fixed mean and SD (which are therefore the input required to specify the distribution of
each hypermean), while the heterogeneities are assumed to follow log-normal distributions,
whose mean and SD (on log-scale) need to be given to the function. Technically, it is
further assumed that for each $i$, $log(\alpha_i)$ and $log(\beta_i)$ may be correlated
with some correlation coefficient $\rho$, but this hyperparameter is automatically
assigned a uniform distribution on the interval $[-1, 1]$, so that its prior does
not need to be specified.

#### Prior for the hypermeans: `prior.mu`
First, consider the prior for the hypermeans, which is encoded in the argument
`prior.mu`. This must be a list with five named entries, where each entry provides
the mean and SD of the distribution of one of the five hypermeans.

The expected format of this argument is:

```r
#               Parameter    Mean        SD
prior.mu = list(mu_a1  =  c(-0.7081851, 2),
                mu_b1  =  c(0,          1),
                mu_a2  =  c(-0.7081851, 2),
                mu_b2  =  c(0,          1),
                mu_eta =  c(0,          1.121))
```

Here, the prefix `mu` indicates that this is a hypermean, while the
suffixes correspond to the parameters as given in the following table.

Parameter       | Suffix
----------      |-------
$log(\alpha_1)$ | `_a1`
$log(\beta_1)$  | `_b1`
$log(\alpha_2)$ | `_a2`
$log(\beta_2)$  | `_b2`
$\eta$          | `_eta`

In the prior list, each of the entries should be of the form `c(x, y)`, where `x`
gives the mean and `y` the SD of the normal distribution assumed for the hypermean
of the corresponding parameter.

The default values were oriented towards [@neuenschwander14] and [@neuenschwander16],
and represent a relatively flexible, weakly informative prior distribution. It
is recommended that this is used as a starting point for adapting the prior
to a given setting, as specific modifations to match the setting of a concrete
trial will most likely provide better performance than the default prior.

Regarding the interpretation of the parameter, $log(\alpha_i)$ gives the median
log-odds of experiencing a DLT following treatment at the reference dose. The value
`-0.7081851` corresponds to

```r
logit(0.33)
#> [1] -0.7081851
```

which means that one assumes the reference dose to have in median a DLT rate of 33%.
This corresponds precisely to the upper boundary of the default target interval
(from 16% to 33%), so that the prior expresses the assumption that the reference
dose is a priori a possible candidate for the MTD (note that the reference dose
should be chosen accordingly).

The default value of the SD of the hypermeans of $log(\alpha_i)$ is `2`, which
represents a relatively large uncertainty and leads to relatively flexible prior.
Note however that depending on the dosing range and other specifications of the
trial, one might want to deviate from this default value. For instance, we may
want to assume a slightly larger uncertainty regarding the intercept to obtain a more conservative setup, e.g. via

```r
prior.mu = list(mu_a1  =  c(-0.7081851, 3),
                mu_b1  =  c(0,          1),
                mu_a2  =  c(-0.7081851, 3),
                mu_b2  =  c(0,          1),
                mu_eta =  c(0,          1.121))
```

Regarding the hyperpriors for $log(\beta)$, a standard normal distribution is assumed.
This covers a relatively broad range of slopes, although one may want to select a
larger or smaller SD in certain cases. Regarding the mean, it is typically
not necessary to deviate from the default of `0` unless there is very concrete
information about the shape of the dose-toxicity relationship.

For the interaction parameter, recall that negative values of $\eta$ express a
lower DLT rate of dose combinations than the interaction free-case (in which the
compounds would cause DLT fully independently from each other), while positive
values lead to a larger DLT rate compared to the interaction-free case.
The default value of $0$ for the mean expresses that both positive and
negative interactions may occur, while the SD of 1.121 is selected so that the
95% credible interval of the interaction-parameters corresponds to an increase
up to 9-fold (or decrease by factor of 9) of the odds for a DLT at the reference
dose. Larger or lower values of mean and SD can be used to obtain more aggressive
or conservative behavior of combination trials. Refer e.g. to [@neuenschwander14]
for more detail on this.

#### Prior for the between-trial heterogeneities: `prior.tau`

The prior parameters for the between-trial heterogeneity control the amount of borrowing
that is performed across trials. In this context, the assumption of a larger
heterogeneity for a parameter allows this parameter to show larger variance
across trials, and, consequently, reduces the influence that data from other
trials have on each jointly modeled trial.

The decider package assumes that the between-trial heterogeneities follow
log-normal distributions, which are specified by providing their mean and SD
on log-scale.

The default value and required format of `prior.tau` is:

```r
#                Parameter    Mean        SD
prior.tau = list(tau_a1  =  c(log(0.25),  log(2)/1.96),
                 tau_b1  =  c(log(0.125), log(2)/1.96),
                 tau_a2  =  c(log(0.25),  log(2)/1.96),
                 tau_b2  =  c(log(0.125), log(2)/1.96),
                 tau_eta =  c(log(0.125), log(2)/1.96))
```

The naming conventions are the same as for `prior.mu`.

Note that a value of `c(x,y)` as `tau_[...]` provides the mean `x` and SD `y` on
log-scale, i.e. if the corresponding hyperparameter is denoted as $\tau$, the
function assumes that $\tau=exp(\psi)$ for some random variable $\psi$ that is
normally distributed with mean `x` and SD `y`.

The default values are oriented towards [@neuenschwander14]. Note that
the SDs are typically all set to either `log(2)/1.96` or `log(4)/1.96` (larger
uncertainty), other values are usually not needed.

To specify the mean for the between-trial heterogeneities, one typically assumes
a specific degree of heterogeneity (cf. table below). By default, `scenario_jointBLRM`
assumes the mean to be `log(0.25)` for the between-trial heterogeneity of
$log(\alpha_i)$, and `log(0.125)` for the heterogeneity of the remaining
parameters. On natural (non-log) scale, this means that differences of the
parameters across trials are in median expected to be 0.25, respectively 0.125.
This is usually referred to as "moderate" between-trial heterogeneity, other
potential values for the mean can be found in the following table.

Heterogeneity   | $log(\alpha_i)$ | $log(\beta_i)$ / $\eta$
----------      |---------------- | -----------------------
Small           | `log(0.125)`    | `log(0.0625)`
Moderate        | `log(0.25)`     | `log(0.125)`
Substantial     | `log(0.5)`      | `log(0.25)`
Large           | `log(1)`        | `log(0.5)`

Regarding the prior setup for the between-trial heterogeneity, the chosen prior
should depend on the expected differences across trials and the number of patients
in the included co-data (larger number of patients may require more heterogeneity
to ensure sufficient robustness). For many situations, the moderate and substantial
configurations from the above table provide acceptable robustness, so that these are
typically considered to be good starting points for prior evaluations. Besides
the evaluations of hypothetical scenarios and simulations (covered in the following
sections), prior effective sample sizes also provide a good way of evaluating
the influence of co-data on the trial of interest and adjusting the priors for
the between-trial heterogeneity accordingly. Refer to [@neuenschwander20a]
for more detail on this type of method for assessing the information
included in the prior.

### Using `scenario_jointBLRM` to evaluate hypothetical data scenarios
Hypothetical data scenarios evaluate the decisions of the BLRM in a number of
concrete situations that might occur in the trial that is planned. While one can
usually not foresee and evaluate all possible situations (mostly due to there
being too many of them), one restricts these evaluations to important classes of
settings. These include but are not limited to:

* Early scenarios that assess the decisions within the first few cohorts of a
  trial, especially scenarios that assume early DLTs.

* Late scenarios that assess the resulting MTD estimates based on the planned
  number of patients (or slightly fewer).

* Scenarios that assess specific critical dosing recommendations, e.g. whether the
  escalation rule ceases to increase the dose when observing certain DLT rates.

* Scenarios that assume heterogeneous co-data. Here, it is e.g. assessed whether
  the decision rule can correctly decide in settings where the involved trials
  or trials show substantially different toxicities.

* Similarly to the previous point, if multiple parallel trials are involved
  that start at different points in time, it should be assessed how the co-data
  influences the start of the trials. For instance, it can happen that the
  combination trial is not allowed to be started at the planned starting dose due
  to toxic monotherapy data. It should therefore be assessed (and aligned with
  ones recommendations) which co-data is needed to allow the planned starting
  dose, and in which cases this would not be recommended by the model.

As an example, consider the scenario that the first cohort of 3 patients was
treated at the dose 0.1 of compound 1 and a second cohort at the dose 0.2. We
assume further that no DLT occurred in the first cohort, while one of the patients
of the second cohort experienced DLT. This translates to the data scenario:

```r
scenario1 = list(
  dose1 = c( 0.1,  0.2),
  dose2 = c( 0,    0),
  n.pat = c( 3,    3),
  n.dlt = c( 0,    1),
  trial = c("A",  "A")
)
```

Note that `"A"` was used as trial name for the monotherapy trial for compound 1,
as this needs to match the name specified in the `trials.of.interest` argument.

Now, the scenario function can be called. Using the previously specified
objects, the function can be applied via

```r

```

Note that the output contains two entries, one for each trial of interest. As we
previously specified the types of these trials, the posterior toxicities of
trial `"A"` are only computed for the doses of interest that represent
monotherapy with compound 1, while the posteriors for trial `"B"` only contain
the combination therapy dose levels.

For each of these doses, the interval probabilities are computed, as well as
summary statistics of the posterior toxicities. By default, the considered
interval probabilities assume a target interval (range of DLT rates considered
to be appropriate as MTD) of $[0.16, 0.33)$. However, if
one is interested in some different interval, say, $[0.2, 0.3)$, this can be
achieved by supplying the optional argument `dosing.intervals = c(0.2, 0.3)`.
In this context, the underdosing, respectively overdosing intervals contain
the DLT rates below, respectively above the target interval.

Further customization of the output can be achieved by supplying the argument
`probs`, which specifies the quantiles listed in the output tables. By default,
the reported quantiles are 2.5\%, 50\%, and 97.5\%. If additional quantiles
shall be computed, say, 25\% and 75\%, this can be achieved e.g. with
`probs = c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975)`.

If additional output plots shall be created (not required for prior evaluation,
but potentially helpful for actual analyses), one can activate this via
`plot.decisions = TRUE`. Usually, simple bar plots are created by this argument
for monotherapy, and a heatmap for combination therapy. By additionally setting
`plot.return = TRUE`, the plots will be contained in the results list in the form
of `ggplot` objects. Refer to the documentation of the `ggplot2` package for detail
on this type of object. The `ggplot2` package also provides a broad range of
functions that can be used to customize the returned plots further. If `plot.return`
is not specified, the function will only print the plots and potentially
save them if the user specified a path for outputs. Additionally, one may want
to control the number of digits the output is rounded to, especially when
considering heatmap-type plots for combination therapy, using e.g. `digits = 3`.

```r
result1a <- scenario_jointBLRM(
  data = scenario1,
  historical.data = historical.data,
  doses.of.interest = doses.of.interest,
  dose.ref1 = dose.ref1,
  dose.ref2 = dose.ref2,
  trials.of.interest = trials.of.interest,
  types.of.interest = types.of.interest,
  prior.mu = prior.mu,
  prior.tau = prior.tau,
  plot.decisions = TRUE,
  plot.return = TRUE,
  ewoc.threshold = 0.25,
  digits = 3
)
```

The generated plots are shown in the plot panel in RStudio. To explicitly display
the returned `ggplot` objects, one can access them as follows.

```r
plot(result1a$plots$"trial-A")
```

![Plot generated by `scenario_jointBLRM()` for trial `"A"`](../man/figures/scenario-plots-1.png)

```r
plot(result1a$plots$"trial-B")
```

![Plot generated by `scenario_jointBLRM()` for trial `"B"`](../man/figures/scenario-plots-2.png)

Note that we supplied an additional argument, `ewoc.threshold`, to the call to
`scenario_jointBLRM`. This argument states
the feasibility bound of the EWOC criterion (cf. Babb et al. (1998)) and is
displayed by the plots to indicate which doses are fulfilling the EWOC criterion
(and could be used for the next cohort). This argument is optional and defaults
to `0.25` if not specified, so that it is actually not needed unless a different
value shall be used as feasibility bound of the EWOC criterion.

There are further options for customizing plots, e.g. to indicate which type of
plots is used for combination therapy trials (heatmap or bar diagram). Detail on
this and further arguments for the output plots are specified in the
documentation.

One can also enable automatic saving of the posterior summaries by
supplying the optional arguments `file.name` and `path`. If the latter specifies
a valid (writable) directory, the output will be saved as `.xlsx` file under
the specified `file.name`. Additionally, one can save the output plots by further
specifying `plots.save = TRUE` (provided a valid `path` and `file.name` were
supplied). In this case, it is recommended to specify the format of the output
plots via `plot.unit`,  `plot.width`, and  `plot.height`. Refer to the
documentation for detail on this.

### Evaluating multiple scenarios in parallel
When setting up a prior, one will typically want to evaluate a number of
scenarios at once, but, as Bayesian computation tends to take relatively long,
this may be rather slow for e.g. 10 or more scenarios. Additionally, one would
need e.g. 10 (or more) calls to `scenario_jointBLRM`, which may not be practical
if the same scenarios are repeatedly evaluated for slightly altered prior
specifications.

To provide slightly more convenience for these types of exercise, the function
`scenario_list_jointBLRM` allows to perform multiple calls to
`scenario_jointBLRM` in parallel for a list of data scenarios, which both speeds
up the computation and simplifies the evaluation of a number of hypothetical
settings. Please note that a parallel backend needs to be registered to
leverage the parallelization, otherwise the function will be executed sequentially.
An example is provided below.

To use this, consider first a (numbered) list of data scenarios. This is
specified as a list of lists, where each sublist must be of the format
expected by the `data` argument of `scenario_jointBLRM`.
For instance, a list with 8 scenarios could look like this:

```r
data.list = list(

  #Scenario 1
  list(
    dose1 = c( 0.1),
    dose2 = c( 0),
    n.pat = c( 3),
    n.dlt = c( 0),
    trial = c("A")),

  #Scenario 2
  list(
    dose1 = c( 0.1),
    dose2 = c( 0),
    n.pat = c( 3),
    n.dlt = c( 1),
    trial = c("A")),

  #Scenario 3
  list(
    dose1 = c( 0.1),
    dose2 = c( 0),
    n.pat = c( 3),
    n.dlt = c( 2),
    trial = c("A")),

  #Scenario 4
  list(
    dose1 = c( 0.1,  0.2),
    dose2 = c( 0,    0),
    n.pat = c( 3,    3),
    n.dlt = c( 0,    1),
    trial = c("A",  "A")),

  #Scenario 5
  list(
    dose1 = c( 0.1,  0.2),
    dose2 = c( 0,    0),
    n.pat = c( 3,    3),
    n.dlt = c( 0,    2),
    trial = c("A",  "A")),

  #Scenario 6
  list(
    dose1 = c( 0.1,  0.2,  0.4),
    dose2 = c( 0,    0,    0),
    n.pat = c( 3,    3,    3),
    n.dlt = c( 0,    0,    1),
    trial = c("A",  "A",  "A")),

  #Scenario 7
  list(
    dose1 = c( 0.1,  0.2,  0.4),
    dose2 = c( 0,    0,    0),
    n.pat = c( 3,    3,    6),
    n.dlt = c( 0,    0,    1),
    trial = c("A",  "A",  "A")),

  #Scenario 8
  list(
    dose1 = c( 0.1,  0.2,  0.4,     0.2),
    dose2 = c( 0,    0,    0,       8),
    n.pat = c( 3,    3,    6,       3),
    n.dlt = c( 0,    0,    1,       0),
    trial = c("A",  "A",  "A",     "B"))
)
```

Note that Scenario 8 also contains cohorts from the combination therapy trial, encoded
with the trial name `"B"` as specified previously. The cohorts can be given in
arbitrary order.

To run the evaluations in parallel, one can additionally register a paralell backend.
There are various existing packages than can achieve this. A basic construct to
register a parallel backend using the `doFuture` package is the following

```r
library(doFuture)

#specify number of cores -- here, only 1 for a sequential exacution
n.cores <- 1

#register backend for parallel execution and plan multisession
doFuture::registerDoFuture()
future::plan(future::multisession, workers=n.cores)
```

In this example, only 1 core is selected, which is identical to a sequential execution.
In practice, `n.cores` can be set depending on the available processor on which
the function is running.

Now, coming back to the evaluation of scenarios, after registration of the
parallel backend one can simply use

```r
results <- scenario_list_jointBLRM(
  data.list = data.list,

  historical.data = historical.data,
  doses.of.interest = doses.of.interest,
  dose.ref1 = dose.ref1,
  dose.ref2 = dose.ref2,
  trials.of.interest = trials.of.interest,
  types.of.interest = types.of.interest,
  prior.mu = prior.mu,
  prior.tau = prior.tau
)

print(results)

Here, except for the first argument, `data.list`, we have
provided precisely the same arguments as for the call to `scenario_jointBLRM`
from the previous section.
This would also work for all other (optional) arguments of `scenario_jointBLRM`,
except for `file.name`. Instead of this argument, `scenario_list_jointBLRM`
uses the optional argument `file.names` (notice the plural), which has the same
function as `file.name` for `scenario_jointBLRM`, but needs to contain a vector
with a file name for each scenario instead. As before, the argument is
ignored unless you want to save the output and have supplied a `path`.

Note further that the historical data provided to `scenario_list_jointBLRM`
is included in the posterior evaluations for every scenario, i.e., the historical
data is interpreted in the same fashion as for `scenario_jointBLRM`, and does
not vary across the scenarios in the list.

To obtain a prior configuration, it is now recommended to create a sufficiently
large number of scenarios, and repeatedly evaluate the scenarios to gradually
alter the prior distribution and obtain an appropriate setup and behavior in
the considered scenarios. However, as mentioned before, one will probably not
be able to consider every potential scenario in advance, so that this is
mostly a heuristic check and is not guaranteed to yield an optimal prior. Due to this,
further evaluation of the prior should be performed to confirm that it shows
appropriate operating characteristics in the long-run. This will be the subject
of the following section.

## Simulating dose-finding trials with `sim_jointBLRM`
Simulations of trials usually aim to estimate the operating characteristics (OC)
of a dose-finding trial design, which includes e.g. the ratio of MTDs declared
on each dose (or on doses with DLT rate in a specific dosing interval), the number
of patients per dose and the number of DLTs in the trial, as well as further
metrics for the simulation results.

To estimate the operating characteristics of the BLRM, one usually uses simulated
trials.
That is, one assumes a fixed set of available dose levels and a fixed
dose-toxicity scenario -- i.e. a specification of the DLT rate for each available
dose level -- and simulates a number of trials in this setting. This allows to
e.g. estimate the average number of MTDs in the correct interval or the number
of patients treated at overly toxic doses for this specific dose-toxicity
scenario.

As it is of course not possible to test all possible dose-toxicity scenarios,
one will typically confine oneself to a selected number of scenarios that
illustrate different possible cases. These should usually range from scenarios
that follow the prior expectations, over more extreme scenarios that assume
the involved drugs to be considerably more (or less) toxic than expected by
the prior, up to scenarios that deliberately assume the trials to result
in heterogeneous data or that the true dose-toxicity relationship does not follow
the logistic model of the BLRM (i.e. one assumes the BLRM to be misspecified).

As an example how such simulations can be performed via `sim_jointBLRM`, we will
again consider the setting of the previous section. For this, recall that a
monotherapy and combination therapy trial shall run (partially) in parallel,
where we wanted to consider the dose levels given in the variable
`doses.of.interest` and use the data from a historical trial as given in the
`historical.data` argument.

The function `sim_jointBLRM` supports simulation of (parallel) monotherapy or
combination therapy trials. Internally, it is differentiated between three types,
namely monotherapy for compound 1 (`"mono1"`), monotherapy for compound 2 (`"mono2"`),
and combination therapy with compounds 1 and 2 (`"combi"`). For each of these types,
the function can actively simulate 2 trials (i.e., six parallel trials in total),
and the order in which cohorts are enrolled in each of the up to six trials
can be specified freely. The simulated trials can be activated independently of
each other, i.e. one can choose how many of the parallel trials are simulated.

Additionally, historical data from arbitrarily many trials that are already
concluded can be given, and furthermore, data that was observed in the actively
simulated trials before the start of the simulation can be included as well
(which allows to simulate how one or more trials might continue after
already having observed a specific data scenario).

### Naming conventions for `sim_jointBLRM`
The function features a large number of optional parameters to allow
relatively flexible customization of the simulated trials, e.g. regarding the
number of patients per cohort, criteria for MTD selection, escalation rules, and
further topics. Refer to the documentation for more detail and the parameters that
are not discussed in this vignette.

To allow some settings to deviate across the simulated trials, many of the
arguments of `sim_jointBLRM` exist in six variations, one for each simulated trial.
To differentiate between these, the arguments feature trial-specific suffixes as
given in the following table.

Trial | Suffix of function arguments
----------|:---------------------:
1st monotherapy trial for compound 1 | `mono1.a`
1st monotherapy trial for compound 2 | `mono2.a`
1st combination therapy trial        | `combi.a`
2nd monotherapy trial for compound 1 | `mono1.b`
2nd monotherapy trial for compound 2 | `mono2.b`
2nd combination therapy trial        | `combi.b`

Here, the first and second trial for a specific trial type mean simply that these
are independently escalating trials of the same type, but does not imply a
specific order or some other dependency across the first and second trial (except
that they are jointly modeled in the BLRM). It is for instance possible to just
simulate the `mono2.b` trial and deactivate all other trials.

The take away message from these naming conventions is that one needs to use the
parameter with the corresponding suffix when an specific option shall only
affect one specific trial but not the others. Arguments that do not have a
suffix will in general always affect all simulated trials.

Apart from the argument names, the suffixes for the six potentially simulated trials
are also used to refer to the corresponding trial when the order in which the trials
enroll cohorts is specified. Furthermore, they are also used to encode the trials
when historical data that was previously recorded in an actively simulated trial
shall be included. Refer to the documentation for more detail.

### Configuring the trial simulations
First and foremost, one needs to decide which of the possible six trials
need to be simulated and activate the corresponding trials. For the example in this
vignette, an monotherapy trial for compound 1 and a combination therapy trial
shall be included. We will assume that we have chosen to utilize the `mono1.a`
and `combi.a` trials to represent these trials (although it would be
equivalent to use the `mono1.b` and `combi.b` trials or even a combination of
`mono1.b` and `combi.a`). To activate the trials, we can supply the arguments

```r
active.mono1.a = TRUE
active.combi.a = TRUE
```

Now, we specify the corresponding available dose levels. For this, we will use
the same doses as specified previously:

```r
doses.mono1.a = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 2.4, 3.6, 5, 6)

doses.combi.a = rbind(
  rep(doses.mono1.a, times=2),
  rep(c(8, 12),      each = length(doses.mono1.a)))
```

Note that `doses.mono1.a` is a vector, while `doses.combi.a` needs
to be a matrix with two rows, so that each column specifies a dose combination
to be considered in the combination therapy trial. The code above generated
every possible combination of the doses from the monotherapy trial for
compound 1 with the doses 8 and 12 for compound 2.

As for the function `scenario_jointBLRM`, one again needs to specify reference
doses and a prior distribution for the BLRM. For this, the same argument names
and formats as for `scenario_jointBLRM` are used, i.e. the arguments
`dose.ref1`, `dose.ref2`, `prior.mu`, and `prior.tau` can be used in the form
that was specified in the previous section. The same holds for the historical data,
for which we will assume that the same observations as before are used, namely

```r
historical.data
#> $dose1
#> [1] 0 0 0 0 0
#> 
#> $dose2
#> [1]  2  4  8 12 16
#> 
#> $n.pat
#> [1]  3  3  3  9 12
#> 
#> $n.dlt
#> [1] 0 0 0 1 2
#> 
#> $trial
#> [1] "H1" "H1" "H1" "H1" "H1"
```

Additionally, we need to provide starting dose levels for each activated trials.
Note that these must be elements of the set of available dose levels, otherwise
the function will report an error. We will assume that the monotherapy trial
will start with the lowest available dose, 0.1, which is specified via

```r
start.dose.mono1.a = 0.1
```

We will later assume additionally that the monotherapy trial enrolls at least 3
or 4 cohorts before the first combination therapy cohort is processed, and due
to this, we assume the combination trial to use a slightly larger starting dose.
For instance, suppose that the combination therapy shall begin with the dose
combination of 0.2 of compound 1 and 8 of compound 2. This is expressed by
using

```r
start.dose.combi.a1 = 0.2
start.dose.combi.a2 = 8
```

Note that two arguments need to be specified for this, with suffix `.combi.a1`
for the first compound and `.combi.a2` for the second compound. Both
of these arguments belong to the `combi.a` trial, while the endings
`.a1`  and `.a2` are used to differentiate between the setting for the first
and second compound of the `combi.a` trial. They are also used for other
arguments that may need different settings for the two combination therapy
partners in the same combination therapy trial.

#### Optional general specification
As a next step, the general course of the trial can be defined, consisting
of the number of patients per cohort, the maximum number of patients in the
trial, and the order in which cohorts are enrolled. All of these arguments
are optional, and relatively sensible defaults will be used when they are
not specified.

First, to set the number of patients per cohort, one can use e.g.

```r
cohort.size = 3
```

Note that `cohort.size` is the global variant of this argument, i.e. it affects all
simulated trials. If it is not provided explicitly, the function will use the default
value of 3. If a specific trial shall deviate from this value, one can
use the trial-specific parameter with the corresponding trial suffix, e.g.

```r
cohort.size.mono1.b = 4
```

Note that this would only affect the `mono1.b` trial, which we do not plan to
simulate in the current example. For the `mono1.a` and  `combi.a` trial, which
we do want to simulate, the global cohort size of 3 is still in effect. The same
would apply if `cohort.size` is not given to the function, as the default value
would have been used in this case.

One can also provide a vector of multiple cohort sizes, in which case the function will
randomly select one of the given cohort sizes for each cohort. The cohort sizes
will then be drawn uniformly at random from the possible numbers specified in
'cohort.size' if no further options are given. If it is desired to draw each
cohort size with a specific probability, one can use the optional argument
`cohort.prob` to provide the probability for each cohort size, e.g. by setting

```r
cohort.size.mono1.b = c(2,    3,    4)
cohort.prob.mono1.b = c(0.05, 0.85, 0.1)
```

In this example, the `mono1.b` trial would select the size of each cohort
randomly according to the corresponding probabilities, i.e. a cohort size of 2
is drawn with a probability of 0.05, a size of 3 with probability 0.85, and a
cohort size of 4 will be chosen with a probability of 0.1. As before, there is a
global and trial-specific version of the argument `cohort.prob`.

As a next step, we want to set the maximum number of patients for each trial.
We will assume the maximum number of patients to be 36 for the
combination therapy trial and 45 for the monotherapy trial. This can be set
via the trial-specific arguments

```r
max.n.mono1.a = 45
max.n.combi.a = 36
```

Note that there is also a global argument `max.n`, which will not be used in this
example.

Now, the order in which cohorts are enrolled is specified. For this,
the function uses the argument `cohort.queue`, which provides, as the name says,
a queue of cohorts that is processed during the simulation. This can be done
by supplying a simple pattern which is automatically repeated (note however that
the function will drop a warning in this case) or by supplying a complex pattern
that already contains every cohort that may potentially be arriving throughout
the trial. For instance, to simply simulate cohorts for `mono1.a` and `combi.a`
alternately, one can use

```r
cohort.queue = c("mono1.a", "combi.a")
```

This order would then be repeated until both trials concluded due to being stopped
early, having found an MTD, or reaching the maximum patient number.

The cohort queue is mostly used to enforce a specific order of the cohorts in
a trial. For this, consider again the example from the previous section, where
a monotherapy and combination trial shall be simulated in parallel. Assume for
instance that one wants to start the combination therapy trial after the first
four monotherapy cohorts were processed, and, afterwards, the trials shall
enroll cohorts alternately. This is expressed by setting the queue to

```r
cohort.queue = c("mono1.a", "mono1.a", "mono1.a", rep(c("mono1.a", "combi.a"),
                                                      times=12))
head(cohort.queue, 9)
#> [1] "mono1.a" "mono1.a" "mono1.a" "mono1.a" "combi.a" "mono1.a" "combi.a" "mono1.a" "combi.a"
```

Note that `c("mono1.a", "combi.a")` is repeated 12 times, which translates to
12 `"combi.a"` and 15 `"mono1.a"` cohorts in the queue. As the cohort size was
previously set to 3 patients, this results in a total of 36 patients for
`combi.a` in the queue and 45 patients for `mono1.a`, i.e. precisely the maximum
sample size that was specified. This ensures that the function will not need to
repeat the queue automatically. Note that it would not be a problem to provide
a cohort queue containing more patients than required, as the function will simply
ignore cohorts for each simulated trial once it has concluded. Therefore, it is
also possible to use e.g.

```r
cohort.queue = c("mono1.a", "mono1.a", "mono1.a", rep(c("mono1.a", "combi.a"),
                                                      times=100))
```

Here, we supplied much more cohorts than needed (100 for combination therapy),
which is still equivalent to the previous queue. Only supplying lower numbers
of cohorts will cause the function to operate differently, as it will repeat the
cohort queue until all trials concluded.

Note that the trials in the cohort queue can also be indicated with numbers (which
usually leads to shorter code than the full trial names), as stated in the following
table.

Trial | Suffix of function arguments | Number
----------|:---------------------:  |:-------------:
1st monotherapy trial for compound 1 | `mono1.a` | 1
1st monotherapy trial for compound 2 | `mono2.a` | 2
1st combination therapy trial        | `combi.a` | 3
2nd monotherapy trial for compound 1 | `mono1.b` | 4
2nd monotherapy trial for compound 2 | `mono2.b` | 5
2nd combination therapy trial        | `combi.b` | 6

Hence, the previous cohort queue could be equivalently written as

```r
cohort.queue = c(1, 1, 1, rep(c(1, 3), times=100))
```

#### Escalation decisions in simulted trials
As a next step, we specify rules for dose escalation decisions. As mentioned
before, the function will by default apply EWOC-based escalation, which means
that only doses can be chosen for which the posterior probability of overdosing
is below 0.25. This boundary could also be altered, by using the argument

```r
ewoc.threshold = 0.25
```

As EWOC only states an upper boundary, the function will afterwards maximize the
probability of having a DLT rate within the target interval among the doses that
satisfy EWOC. If this still leads to
multiple possible doses, the function will subsequently maximize the dose of the
first compound among the doses with the same probability of target dosing.
To maximize the second compound instead, one can set the argument
`esc.comp.max`, which may have the values `1` or `2` and indicates which
component the function will maximize in case of draws. Note that one can also
deviate from maximizing the target probability and maximize directly the dose
among the levels that satisfy EWOC, but this is not covered in this vignette.
Refer to the documentation of the argument `esc.rule` for information on this.

@neuenschwander14 recommend to impose a maximum increment of the
dose additionally to EWOC, in order to avoid overly large dosing steps during
dose escalations. This can be realized by using the `esc.step` family of
arguments, which is available as a global variant and six trial-specific
parameters. The escalation step is interpreted as the maximum factor of dose
escalation. For instance, when an escalation step is set to the value 2, the dose
can at most be doubled in each escalation decision. If no escalation step is
given, the function will set it to the maximum factor between subsequent dose
levels as an additional constrain on the escalation.

However, there might be situations in which one may not want a fixed maximum
factor between escalations, e.g. if a factor cannot express the increments
between planned dose levels. Consider for instance a trial with planned doses of
10, 20, 30, and 40 mg. In order to allow escalating from 10 to 20, the escalation
step would need to be set to 2, but this would also allow escalating from 20
to 40 without enrolling patients at 30. To prevent this, one can set

```r
esc.constrain = TRUE
```

This argument constrains escalations to the given set of dose levels, i.e. only
the next larger prespecified dose can be used. If activated, `esc.constrain`
causes the function to ignore any given escalation step and always restrict
escalation decisions to the next larger dose (but does not pose a boundary
when deescalating the dose). As before, `esc.constrain` is the global variant,
while additional arguments like `esc.constrain.mono1.b` only affect the
corresponding trial.

#### MTD selection
It now remains to specify the rules for MTD selection in the trial.

There are two different arguments that control how the function selects the MTD
of a simulated trial, namely `mtd.decision` and `mtd.enforce`. Both are available
as global arguments without suffix and as trial-specific argument with the
corresponding suffix. The argument `mtd.decision` is a named list with five
entries of the form

```r
mtd.decision = list(
  min.dlt     = 1,
  pat.at.mtd  = 6,
  min.pat     = 12,
  target.prob = 0.5,
  rule        = 2
)
```

The list stated above is also the default argument. The first four list entries
correspond to the demanded boundaries of four different conditions that are
used to determine an MTD. The last entry, `mtd.decision$rule` does not pose
a condition itself, but dictates which of the other conditions are mandatory instead.

During the simulation, the MTD can only be determined as the dose that was used
for the last cohort, which is always the current candidate for the MTD.
For MTD selection, the function will then first demand that the current dose level
is also recommended for the next cohort again (so-called stabilization criterion).
If this is the case, it will check whether the current dose also satisfies the
conditions determined by `mtd.decision`, and, if these are satisfied, declare the
current dose to be the MTD of this trial. The precise conditions and the
corresponding entries in `mtd.decision` are listed in the following table.

No.     | List entry    |  Condition
:--------|:-----------  |:-----------------------
1       | `min.dlt`     | At least `min.dlt` patients with DLTs were observed in the trial.
2       | `pat.at.mtd`  | At least `pat.at.mtd` patients were treated with the current dose.
3       | `min.pat`     | At least `min.pat` patients were treated in the current trial.
4       | `target.prob` | The probability that the current dose has DLT rate in the target interval is at least `target.prob`.

In terms of the effect of the entry `rule`, the following to possibilities are supported

* __If `rule` is `1`__: Conditions 1 and 2 are necessary, and at least one of conditions 3 and 4 must be satisfied as well.

* __If `rule` is `2`__: Conditions 1 and 3 are necessary, and at least one of conditions 2 and 4 must be satisfied as well.

Other decision rule specifications may be supported in the future.

The second argument that affects MTD selection, `mtd.enforce`, is a logical
value that controls how the function behaves when a trial reaches the specified
maximum sample size. By default, `mtd.enforce` is `FALSE`, which causes trials
that reach the maximum sample size to be considered as not having found an MTD,
which will also be noted in the output. If the parameter is instead `TRUE`, the
current dose will be considered the MTD when the maximum sample size is reached
before the conditions for MTD selections are satisfied. This can e.g. be used if
one wants to approximate the average dosing recommendations after a specific
number of cohorts based on simulations. For instance, when `max.n = 15`,
`mtd.enforce = TRUE`, one can set `mtd.decision` to values that cannot be
reached within 15 patients (e.g., `mtd.decision$rule = 2` and `mtd.decision$min.pat = 16`),
so that the function will simply report the dosing recommendation after 15
patients as the MTD and not apply the MTD decision rule. This option can also be
set for individual trials (via the parameters with the corresponding suffix).

#### Dose-toxicity scenarios and trial simulations
It remains to specify a dose-toxicity scenario before the simulation can be started.
That is, a DLT rate for each dose level is assumed, which is then used by the
function to simulate the number of patients experiencing DLT in each cohort.

The arguments for specifying the DLT rate in one of the simulated trials
are named according to the pattern `tox.[...]`, where `[...]` can be any of the
trial-specific suffixes. Note that there is no global variant of this argument.
For the situation discussed in the previous chapters, the required arguments are
therefore `tox.mono1.a` and `tox.combi.a`.

First, recall the specification of the dose levels for the monotherapy trial:

```r
doses.mono1.a
#> [1] 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.8 1.6 2.4 3.6 5.0 6.0
```

The DLT rates (or toxicities) must therefore be specified for 9 dose levels. This
is done by supplying a vector of this length, so that the entry `tox.mono1.a[i]`
specifies the DLT rate of the dose given in `doses.mono1.a[i]`. In our case,
this could e.g. be

```r
#Compound 1:     0.1   0.2   0.4   0.8   1.6   2.4   3.6   5     6
tox.mono1.a = c(0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.09, 0.12, 0.19, 0.29, 0.43)
```

Similarly, for the combination therapy trial, the dose levels were given as

```r
doses.combi.a
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] [,12] [,13] [,14] [,15] [,16] [,17] [,18]
#> [1,]  0.1  0.2  0.4  0.8  1.6  2.4  3.6    5    6   0.1   0.2   0.4   0.8   1.6   2.4   3.6     5     6
#> [2,]  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0  8.0    8    8  12.0  12.0  12.0  12.0  12.0  12.0  12.0    12    12
```

Here, each column specifies a dose, so that the argument `tox.combi.a` needs one
entry for each column, i.e. 18 entries in our example. Similarly to before,
entry `i` of the argument provides the DLT rate of the dose given in column `i`
of `doses.combi.a`. Hence, a dose-toxicity scenario for this case could be

```r
#Compound 1:     0.1   0.2   0.4   0.8   1.6   2.4   3.6   5     6        0.1   0.2   0.4   0.8   1.6   2.4   3.6   5     6
#compound 2:     8     8     8     8     8     8     8     8     8        12    12    12    12    12    12    12    12    12
tox.combi.a = c(0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.08, 0.14, 0.21, 0.32, 0.39, 0.47,    0.04, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.17, 0.29, 0.45, 0.52, 0.61)
```

Note that one will usually consider multiple different dose toxicity scenarios
to assess the performance of the prior in different settings and situations. In
the following, we will only consider the scenario specified above for simplicity.

This completes the setup and specification of the trials that are to be simulated.
As a last step, it remains to specify the number of simulated studies via the
parameter `n.studies`. As an example, 1 study will be used in the following.
Note however that this is of course by far not sufficient for a proper evaluation
of the prior, where one should simulate something around the order of e.g. 1000
to 10000 studies. However, be aware that depending on the specifications, each study will
require up to multiple minutes of run time for the repeated calls to Stan, so
that 1000 or more trials may take multiple hours or even nearly a day to simulate. It is
therefore recommended to run the simulation in parallel.

If a cluster is available, a parallel backend consisting of multiple nodes
with multiple cores can be registered, so that the function can leverage the
capabilities of a cluster with a nested foreach loop. This is however purely optional.
Further, when
running simulations in parallel with a moderate number of cores, it is
recommended to consider the argument `working.path` in the documentation, as this
allows to save a reload MCMC results across nodes and cores.

At last, one can also optionally specify the arguments `path` and `file.name`,
which will cause the function to automatically write the summarized simulation results
to a `.xlsx` file of the specified name under the specified path. Otherwise, the
simulation results are only returned to R.

Putting all of the previous explanations together, the call to `sim_jointBLRM`
would therefore be:

```r
sim_result <- sim_jointBLRM(
  active.mono1.a = TRUE,
  active.combi.a = TRUE,

  doses.mono1.a = doses.mono1.a,
  doses.combi.a = doses.combi.a,
  dose.ref1 = dose.ref1,
  dose.ref2 = dose.ref2,
  start.dose.mono1.a = start.dose.mono1.a,
  start.dose.combi.a1 = start.dose.combi.a1,
  start.dose.combi.a2 = start.dose.combi.a2,

  tox.mono1.a = tox.mono1.a,
  tox.combi.a = tox.combi.a,

  historical.data = historical.data,
  prior.mu = prior.mu,
  prior.tau = prior.tau,

  max.n.mono1.a = max.n.mono1.a,
  max.n.combi.a = max.n.combi.a,
  cohort.size = cohort.size,
  cohort.queue = cohort.queue,
  ewoc.threshold = ewoc.threshold,
  esc.constrain = esc.constrain,
  mtd.decision = mtd.decision,

  n.studies = 1
)
