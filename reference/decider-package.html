to determine the MTD so that it has a true DLT rate in some pre-specified
dosing interval. Note that other therapeutic areas often use slightly
different notions instead."><title>The 'decider' package: DECIsion making in oncology Dose Escalation trials with logistic Regression — decider-package • decider</title><script src="../deps/jquery-3.6.0/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"><link href="../deps/bootstrap-5.2.2/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"><script src="../deps/bootstrap-5.2.2/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><!-- Font Awesome icons --><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha256-mmgLkCYLUQbXn0B1SRqzHar6dCnv9oZFPEC1g1cwlkk=" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/v4-shims.min.css" integrity="sha256-wZjR52fzng1pJHwx4aV2AO3yyTOXrcDW7jBpJtTwVxw=" crossorigin="anonymous"><!-- bootstrap-toc --><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@v1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js" integrity="sha256-4veVQbu7//Lk5TSmc7YV48MxtMy98e26cf5MrgZYnwo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- headroom.js --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/headroom.min.js" integrity="sha256-AsUX4SJE1+yuDu5+mAVzJbuYNPHj/WroHuZ8Ir/CkE0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/jQuery.headroom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZX/yNShbjqsohH1k95liqY9Gd8uOiE1S4vZc+9KQ1K4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- clipboard.js --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/clipboard.js/2.0.6/clipboard.min.js" integrity="sha256-inc5kl9MA1hkeYUt+EC3BhlIgyp/2jDIyBLS6k3UxPI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- search --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fuse.js/6.4.6/fuse.js" integrity="sha512-zv6Ywkjyktsohkbp9bb45V6tEMoWhzFzXis+LrMehmJZZSys19Yxf1dopHx7WzIKxr5tK2dVcYmaCk2uqdjF4A==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/autocomplete.js/0.38.0/autocomplete.jquery.min.js" integrity="sha512-GU9ayf+66Xx2TmpxqJpliWbT5PiGYxpaG8rfnBEk1LL8l1KGkRShhngwdXK1UgqhAzWpZHSiYPc09/NwDQIGyg==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mark.js/8.11.1/mark.min.js" integrity="sha512-5CYOlHXGh6QpOFA/TeTylKLWfB3ftPsde7AnmhuitiTX4K5SqCLBeKro6sPS8ilsz1Q4NRx3v8Ko2IBiszzdww==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- pkgdown --><script src="../pkgdown.js"></script><meta property="og:title" content="The 'decider' package: DECIsion making in oncology Dose Escalation trials with logistic Regression — decider-package"><meta property="og:description" content="Performs Bayesian logistic regression for binary dose-toxicity
